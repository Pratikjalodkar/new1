## Tech Stack

The tech stack used in this e-commerce backend project includes the following components:


#### Backend Framework: 
Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Django REST Framework: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django, providing features like serialization, authentication, and viewsets.

#### Database:
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database that is used for development and testing. 

#### Authentication:
Django's Built-in Authentication: Utilizes Django's built-in user model for user management.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implemented using djangorestframework-simplejwt for secure token-based authentication.

#### Serialization:
Django REST Framework Serializers: Used to convert complex data types (like querysets and model instances) into native Python data types that can then be easily rendered into JSON or other content types.

#### Permissions:
Custom Permissions: Implemented to restrict access to certain views based on user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

#### API Documentation:
Postman: Used for creating and testing API endpoints, as well as for generating API documentation.

#### Development Tools:
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the backend logic.

Django Admin: Provides an interface for managing the database and content easily.

#### Other Technologies:

Git: Version control system used for tracking changes in the codebase.

GitHub: Used for hosting the project repository and collaboration.
